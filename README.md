# ML-Final-Project-Predicting-Next-Day-Rain-in-Australia
For my ITP 449 final project, I built a machine learning classifier to predict next day rain in Australia. Out of the 6 models I constructed,
the Random Forest Classifier had the highest accuracy. I then fine tuned the parameters to improve the model's accuracy.
